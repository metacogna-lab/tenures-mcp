# Guide for Agents

**Tenure MCP Server** helps Ray White agents work smarter: less manual copying, clearer visibility on vendors and tenants, and built-in checks so sensitive actions stay under your control.

## What You Can Do

- **Weekly vendor reports** — One flow pulls property details, open home feedback, and market context into a single report.
- **Open home feedback summaries** — See sentiment and top comments from open home data without opening multiple screens.
- **Rent arrears and breach risk** — View ledger-based arrears and get a clear risk level plus recommended next steps.
- **Compliance and important dates** — Extract text from documents and highlight expiry and compliance dates.
- **Draft breach notices** — Generate draft breach notices with a required approval step before anything is sent.

## Key Features

### Vendor Reports

Reports are generated automatically by combining property information, open home feedback, and market trends. You get a weekly-style report in one go instead of pulling data from several systems.

### Open Home Feedback

Feedback from open homes is analysed for sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) and summarised so you can quickly see what visitors thought and share the highlights with vendors.

### Rent Arrears and Breach Risk

The system uses ledger data to show current arrears, days overdue, and breach risk (e.g. low, medium, high, critical). It suggests actions so you can prioritise which tenancies need attention.

### Compliance and Documents

Uploaded documents (contracts, certificates, etc.) can be processed to extract text and find important dates such as expiry or “valid until”. That helps you keep on top of compliance without manually scanning every file.

### Breach Notices

You can generate draft breach notices (e.g. rent arrears, lease violation, property damage). These stay in draft until someone with the right access approves them, so nothing is sent by mistake.

## How It Fits Your Day

Use the **Agent Console**: pick a flow (e.g. Weekly Vendor Report or Arrears Detection), enter the property or tenancy ID, and run it. Results appear in the same screen so you can review, copy, or share without switching between systems.

---

## Security and Control

Access is role-based so people only see and do what they’re allowed. Actions that change something material (like sending a breach notice) require an explicit approval step and are logged for audit. Sensitive data in responses is reduced where appropriate.

## Next Steps

- **Try the console** — Open the Agent Console from the landing page, choose a flow, and run it with a sample property or tenancy ID.
- **Get access** — Contact your office or platform admin for credentials and any internal links (e.g. staging or production).
